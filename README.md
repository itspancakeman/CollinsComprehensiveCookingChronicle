# Hiya! Welcome!

## My name is Collin St-Onge and this is my second project for General Assembly's SEBPT class.

The goal of the project is the build a full stack application from scratch! My app has yet to be named but will be a cooking resource with several databases that make it easy to find a recipe for dinner, learn more about ingredients you'd like to try, or keep track of your own learning goals!

Below are screenshots of my wireframes for the app:
