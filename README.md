# Hiya! Welcome!

## My name is Collin St-Onge and this is my second project for General Assembly's SEBPT class.

The goal of the project is the build a full stack application from scratch! My app, Collin'sComprehensiveCookingChronicle, has several databases that make it easy to find a recipe for dinner, learn more about ingredients you'd like to try, or keep track of your own learning goals!

Below are screenshots of my wireframes for the app:

Below is a screenshot of my DB schema, note the connections, which will allow for maximum knowledge about what you're eating in each recipe.

Below here you can also find a screenshot of some of my first user stories. I'm planning to stay organized and Agile with the Scrum management tool Jira, pictured below.

## UPDATE 3 

All of my ```GET``` routes and ```ejs``` pages are now working as intended, last functionality things to add are 2 ```PUT``` and ```DELETE``` routes plus integrating an API.
I have also finished styling for my home page which should act as a great template for quickly styling the other pages.
After these few items are completed I will just have to make sure a few ```<a>``` tags actually have places to go and I will be in the read-to-deliver zone. 
Stretch goals for ahead of the actual due date for this project primarily revolve around adding more data. I'd like to seed a few more things to make sure the app actually has some content to it.
